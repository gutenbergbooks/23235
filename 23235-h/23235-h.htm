<h3>HIGH CHURCH AND LOW CHURCH.</h3>

  <p><i>A Universal History of Party; with the Origin of Party Names</i><a
  name="footnotetag1" href="#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> would form an
  acceptable addition to literary history: "N. &amp; Q." has contributed
  towards such a work some disquisitions on our party names <i>Whig</i> and
  <i>Tory</i>, and <i>The Good Old Cause</i>. Such names as <i>Puritan</i>,
  <i>Malignant</i>, <i>Evangelical</i><a name="footnotetag2"
  href="#footnote2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>, can be traced up to their first
  commencement, but some obscurity hangs on the mintage-date of the names
  we are about to consider.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, the distinction of <i>High Church</i> and <i>Low
  Church</i> always existed in the Reformed English Church, and the history
  of these parties would be her history. But the <i>names</i> were not
  coined till the close of the seventeenth century, and were not stamped in
  full relief as party-names till the first year of Queen Anne's reign.</p>

  <p>In October, 1702, Anne's first Parliament and Convocation
  assembled:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"From the deputies in Convocation at this period, the appellations
  <i>High Church</i> and <i>Low Church</i> originated, and they were
  afterwards used to distinguish the clergy. It is singular that the
  bishops<a name="footnotetag3" href="#footnote3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> were
  ranked among <!-- Page 118 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page118"></a>{118}</span>the Low Churchmen (see Burnet, v. 138.;
  Calamy, i. 643.; Tindal's <i>Cont.</i>, iv. 591.)"&mdash;Lathbury's
  <i>Hist. of the Convocation</i>, Lond. 1842, p. 319.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Mr. Lathbury is a very respectable authority in matters of this kind,
  but if he use "originated" in its strict sense, I am inclined to think he
  is mistaken; as I am tolerably certain that I have met with the words
  several years before 1702. At the moment, however, I cannot lay my hands
  on a passage to support this assertion.</p>

  <p>The disputes in Convocation gave rise to a number of pamphlets, such
  as <i>A Caveat against High Church</i>, Lond. 1702, and <i>The Low
  Churchmen vindicated from the unjust Imputation of being No Churchmen, in
  Answer to a Pamphlet called "The Distinction of High and Low Church
  considered:</i>" Lond. 1706, 8vo. Dr. Sacheverell's trial gave additional
  zest to the <i>dudgeon ecclesiastick</i>, and produced a shower of
  pamphlets. I give the title of one of them: <i>Pulpit War, or Dr.
  S&mdash;&mdash;l, the High Church Trumpet, and Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;ly, the
  Low Church Drum, engaged by way of Dialogue</i>, Lond. 1710, 8vo.</p>

  <p>To understand the cause of the exceeding bitterness and virulence
  which animated the parties denominated <i>High Church</i> and <i>Low
  Church</i>, we must remember that until the time of William of Orange,
  the Church of England, <i>as a body</i>&mdash;her sovereigns and bishops,
  her clergy and laity&mdash;comes under the <i>former</i> designation;
  while those who sympathised with the Dissenters were comparatively few
  and weak. As soon as William was head of the Church, he opened the
  floodgates of Puritanism, and admitted into the church what previously
  had been more or less external to it. This element, thus made part and
  parcel of the Anglican Church, was denominated <i>Low Church</i>. William
  supplanted the bishops and clergy who refused to take oaths of allegiance
  to him as king <i>de jure</i>; and by putting Puritans in their place,
  made the latter the dominant party. Add to this the feelings of
  exasperation produced by the murder of Charles I., and the expulsion of
  the Stuarts, and we have sufficient grounds, political and religious, for
  an irreconcilable feud. Add, again, the reaction resulting from the
  overthrow of the tyrannous hot-bed and forcing-system, where a sham
  conformity was maintained by coercion; and the <i>Church-Papist</i>, as
  well as the <i>Church-Puritans</i>, with ill-concealed hankering after
  the mass and the preaching-house, by penal statutes were forced to do
  what their souls abhorred, and play the painful farce of attending the
  services of "The Establishment."</p>

  <p>A writer in a <i>High Church</i> periodical of 1717 (prefacing his
  article with the passage from Proverbs vi. 27.) proceeds:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The old way of attacking the Church of England was by mobs and
  bullies, and hard sounds; by calling <i>Whore</i>, and <i>Babylon</i>,
  upon our worship and liturgy, and kicking out our clergy as <i>dumb
  dogs</i>: but now they have other irons in the fire; a new engine is set
  up under the cloak and disguise of <i>temper, unity, comprehension, and
  the Protestant religion</i>. Their business now is not to storm the
  Church, but to <i>lull it to sleep</i>: to make us relax our care, quit
  our defences, and neglect our safety.... These are the politics of their
  Popish fathers: when <i>they</i> had tried all other artifices, they at
  last resolved to sow schism and division in the Church: and from thence
  sprang up this very generation, who by a fine stratagem endeavoured to
  set us one against the other, and they gather up the stakes. <i>Hence the
  distinction of High and Low Church.</i>"&mdash;<i>The Scourge</i>, p.
  251.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In another periodical of the same date, in the Dedication "To the most
  famous University of Oxford," the writer says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"These enemies of our religious and civil establishment have
  represented you as instillers of <i>slavish doctrines and principles</i>
  ... if to give to God and Cæsar his due be such tow'ring, and <i>High
  Church</i> principles, I am sure St. Peter and St. Paul will scarce
  escape being censured for <i>Tories</i> and
  <i>Highflyers</i>."&mdash;<i>The Entertainer</i>, Lond. 1717.</p>

  <p>"If those who have kept their first love, and whose robes have not
  been defiled, endeavour to stop these innovations and corruptions that
  their enemies would introduce, they are blackened for <i>High Church
  Papists</i>, favourers of I know not who, and fall under the public
  resentment."&mdash;<i>Ib.</i> p. 301.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I shall now give a few extracts from <i>Low Church</i> writers (quoted
  in <i>The Scourge</i>), who thus designate their opponents:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A pack or party of scandalous, wicked, and profane men, who
  appropriate to themselves the name of <i>High Church</i> (but may more
  properly be said to be Jesuits or Papists in masquerade), do take liberty
  to teach, preach, and print, publickly and privately, sedition,
  contentions, and divisions among the Protestants of this
  kingdom."&mdash;<i>Motives to Union</i>, p. 1.</p>

  <p>"These men glory in their being members of the <i>High Church</i>
  (Popish appellation, and therefore they are the more fond of that); but
  these pretended sons are become her persecutors, and they exercise their
  spite and lies both on the living and the dead."&mdash;<i>The Snake in
  the Grass brought to Light</i>, p. 8.</p>

  <p>Sir W. Scott, in his <i>Life of Dryden</i>, Lond. 1808, observes
  that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Towards the end of Charles the Second's reign, the
  <i>High-Church-men</i> and the Catholics regarded themselves as on the
  same side in political questions, and not greatly divided in their
  temporal interests. Both were sufferers in the plot, both were enemies of
  the sectaries, both were adherents of the Stuarts. Alternate conversion
  had been common between them, so early as since Milton made a reproach to
  the English Universities of the converts to the Roman faith daily made

  <p>I quote this passage partly because it gives Sir Walter's
  interpretation of that obscure passage in <i>Lycidas</i>, respecting
  which I made a Query (Vol. ii., p. 246.), but chiefly as a preface to the
  remark that in James II.'s reign, and at the time these party names
  originated, the Roman Catholics were in league with the Puritans or
  <i>Low Church</i> party against the High Churchmen, which increased the
  acrimony of both parties.</p>

  <p>In those days religion was politics, and politics religion, with most
  of the belligerents. Swift, however, as if he wished to be thought an
  exception to the general rule, chose one party for its politics and the
  other for its religion.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Swift carried into the ranks of the Whigs the opinions and scruples
  of a <i>High Church</i> clergyman... Such a distinction between opinions
  in Church and State has not frequently existed: the <i>High Churchmen</i>
  being usually <i>Tories</i>, and the <i>Low Church</i> divines
  universally <i>Whigs</i>."&mdash;Scott's <i>Life</i>, 2nd edit.: Edin.
  1824, p. 76.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>See Swift's <i>Discourse of the Contests and Dissensions between the
  Nobles and Commons of Athens and Rome:</i> Lond. 1701.</p>

  <p>In his quaint <i>Argument against abolishing Christianity</i>, Lond.
  1708, the following passage occurs:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"There is one advantage, greater than any of the foregoing, proposed
  by the abolishing of Christianity: that it will utterly extinguish
  parties among us by removing those factious distinctions of <i>High</i>
  and <i>Low Church</i>, of <i>Whig</i> and <i>Tory</i>, Presbyterian and
  Church of England."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Scott says of the <i>Tale of a Tub:</i></p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The main purpose is to trace the gradual corruptions of the Church of
  Rome, and to exalt the English Reformed Church at the expense both of the
  Roman Catholic and Presbyterian establishments. It was written with a
  view to the interests of the <i>High Church</i>
  party."&mdash;<i>Life</i>, p. 84.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Most men will concur with Jeffrey, who observes:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"It is plain, indeed, that Swift's <i>High Church</i> principles were
  all along but a part of his selfishness and ambition; and meant nothing
  else, than a desire to raise the consequence of the order to which he
  happened to belong. If he had been a layman, we have no doubt he would
  have treated the pretensions of the priesthood as he treated the persons
  of all priests who were opposed to him, with the most bitter and
  irreverent disdain."&mdash;<i>Ed. Rev.</i>, Sept. 1846.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The following lines are from a squib of eight stanzas which occurs in
  the works of Jonathan Smedley, and are said to have been fixed on the
  door of St. Patrick's Cathedral on the day of Swift's instalment (see
  Scott, p. 174.):</p>

  of the famous South:&mdash;'Why,' said he, 'the High Church are those who
  think highly of the Church, and lowly of themselves; the Low Church are
  those who think highly of themselves, and lowly of the
  Church."&mdash;Rev. H. Newland's <i>Lecture on Tractarianism</i>, Lond.

  <p>The most celebrated High Churchmen who lived in the last century, are
  Dr. South, Dr. Samuel Johnson, Rev. Wm. Jones of Nayland, Bp. Horne, Bp.
  Wilson, and Bp. Horsley. See a long passage on "High Churchmen" in a
  charge of the latter to the clergy of St. David's in the year 1799, pp.

  <p>It is not so very "singular," when we remember that the bishops were
  what Lord Campbell and Mr. Macauley call "<i>judiciously</i> chosen" by
  William. On this point a cotemporary remarks, "Some steps have been made,
  and large ones too, towards <i>a Scotch</i> reformation, by suspending
  and ejecting the chief and most zealous of our bishops, and others of the
  higher clergy; and by advancing, upon all vacancies of sees and
  dignities, ecclesiastical <i>men of notoriously Presbyterian, or, which

  majority; and then we may expect the new model of a church to be
  perfected." (Somers' <i>Tracts</i>, vol. x. p. 368.) Until Atterbury,

<h3>CONCLUDING NOTES ON SEVERAL MISUNDERSTOOD
WORDS.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(<i>Continued from</i> Vol. vii., p. 568.)</p>

  <p>Not being minded to broach any fresh matter in "N. &amp; Q.," I shall
  now only crave room to clear off an old score, lest I should leave myself
  open to the imputation of having cast that in the teeth of a numerous
  body of men which might, for aught they would know to the contrary, be as
  truly laid in my own dish. In No. 189., p. 567., I affirmed that the
  handling of a passage in <i>Cymbeline</i>, there quoted, had betrayed an
  amount of obtuseness in the commentators which would be discreditable in
  a third-form schoolboy. To substantiate that assertion, and rescue the
  disputed word "Britaine" henceforth for ever from the rash tampering of
  the meddlesome sciolist, I beg to advertise the ingenuous reader that the
  clause,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"For being now a favourer to the Britaine,"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>is in apposition with <i>Death</i>, not with Posthumus Leonatus. In a
  note appended to this censure, referring to another passage from
  L.&nbsp;L.&nbsp;L., I averred that <span class="sc">Mr. Collier</span> had
  corrupted it by chancing the singular verb <i>dies</i> into the plural
  <i>die</i> (this too done, under plea of editorial licence, without
  warning to the reader), and that such corruption had abstracted the true
  key to the right construction. To make good this last position, two
  things I must do first, cite the whole passage, without change of letter
  or tittle, as it stands in the Folios '23 and '32; next, show the trivial
  and vulgar use of "contents" as a singular noun. In Folio '23, thus:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"<i>Qu.</i> Nay my good Lord, let me ore-rule you now;</p>
      <p>That sport best pleases that doth least know how.</p>
      <p>Where Zeale striues to content, and the contents</p>
      <p>Dies in the Zeale of that which it presents:</p>
      <p>Their forme confounded, makes most forme in mirth</p>
      <p>When great things labouring perish in their birth."</p>
      <p class="i12">Act IV. p. 141.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>With this the Folio '32 exactly corresponds, save that the speaker is
  <i>Prin.</i>, not <i>Qu</i>.; <i>ore-rules</i> is written as two words
  without the hyphen, and <i>strives</i> for <i>striues</i>. I have been
  thus precise, because criticism is to me not "a game," nor admissive of
  cogging and falsification.</p>

  <p>I must now show the hackneyed use of <i>contents</i> as a singular
  noun. An anonymous correspondent of "N. &amp; Q." has already pointed out
  one in <i>Measure for Measure</i>, Act IV. Sc. 2.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<i>Duke</i>. The <i>contents</i> of this is the returne of the
  Duke."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>If the reader wants more examples, let him give himself the trouble to
  open the first book that comes to hand, and I dare say the perusal of a
  dozen pages will supply some; yet have we two editors of Shakspeare,
  Johnson and Collier, so unacquainted with the usage of their own tongue,
  and the universal logic of thought, as not to know that a word like
  <i>contents</i>, according as it is understood collectively or
  distributively, may be, and, as we have just seen, in fact is, treated as
  a singular or plural; that, I say, <i>contents</i> taken severally, every
  <i>content</i>, or in gross, the whole mass, is respectively plural or
  singular. It was therefore optional with Shakspeare to employ the word
  either as a singular or plural, but not in the same sentence to do both:
  here, however, he was tied <!-- Page 121 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page121"></a>{121}</span>to the singular, for, wanting a rhyme to
  <i>contents</i>, the nominative to <i>presents</i> must be singular, and
  that nominative was the pronoun of <i>contents</i>. Since, therefore, the
  plural <i>die</i> and the singular <i>it</i> could not both be referable
  to the same noun <i>contents</i>, by silently substituting <i>die</i> for
  <i>dies</i>, <span class="sc">Mr. Collier</span> has blinded his reader
  and wronged his author. The purport of the passage amounts to this: the
  <i>contents</i>, or structure (to wit, of the show to be exhibited),
  breaks down in the performer's zeal to the subject which it presents.
  Johnson very properly adduces a much happier expression of the same
  thought from <i>A Midsummer Night's Dreame</i>:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"<i>Hip.</i> I love not to see wretchedness o'ercharged;</p>
      <p>And duty in his service perishing."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The reader cannot fail to have observed the faultless punctuation of
  the Folios in the forecited passage, and I think concur with me, that
  like many, ay, most others, all it craves at the hands of editors and
  commentators is, to be left alone. The last two lines ask for no
  explanation even to the blankest mind. Words like <i>contents</i> are by
  no means rare in English. We have <i>tidings</i> and <i>news</i>, both
  singular and plural. <span class="sc">Mr. Collier</span> himself rebukes
  Malone for his ignorance of such usage of the latter word. If it be said
  that these two examples have no singular form, whereas <i>contents</i>
  has, there is <i>means</i>, at any rate precisely analogous. On the other
  hand, so capricious is language, in defiance of the logic of thought, we
  have, if I may so term it, a merely auricular plural, in the word
  <i>corpse</i> referred to a single carcase.</p>

  <p>I should here close my account with "N. &amp; Q." were it not that I
  have an act of justice to perform. When I first lighted upon the two
  examples of <i>chaumbre</i> in Udall, I thought, as we say in this
  country, it was a good "fundlas," and regarded it as my own property. It
  now appears to be but a waif or stray; therefore, <i>suum cuique</i>, I
  cheerfully resign the credit of it to <span class="sc">Mr. Singer</span>,
  the rightful proprietary. Proffering them for the inspection of learned
  and unlearned, I of course foresaw that speedy sentence would be
  pronounced by that division, whose judgment, lying ebb and close to the
  surface, must needs first reach the light. I know no more appropriate
  mode of requiting the handsome manner in which <span class="sc">Mr.
  Singer</span> has been pleased to speak of my trifling contributions to
  "N. &amp; Q.," than by asking him, with all the modesty of which I am
  master, to reconsider the passage in <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>; for though
  his substitution (<i>rumourers</i> vice <i>runawayes</i>) may, I think,
  clearly take the wall of any of its rivals, yet, believing that Juliet
  invokes a darkness to shroud her lover, under cover of which even the
  fugitive from justice might snatch a wink of sleep, I must for my own
  part, as usual, still adhere to the authentic text.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">W. R. Arrowsmith</span>.

  <p>P. S.&mdash;In answer to a Bloomsbury Querist (Vol. viii., p. 44.), I
  crave leave to say that I never have met with the verb <i>perceyuer</i>
  except in Hawes, <i>loc. cit.</i>; and I gave the latest use that I could
  call to mind of the noun in my paper on that word. Unhappily I never make
  notes, but rely entirely on a somewhat retentive memory; therefore the
  instances that occur on the spur of the moment are not always the most
  apposite that might be selected for the purpose of illustration. If,
  however, he will take the trouble to refer to a little book, consisting
  of no more than 448 pages, published in 1576, and entitled <i>A Panoplie
  of Epistles, or a Looking-glasse for the Unlearned</i>, by Abraham
  Flemming, he will find no fewer than nine examples, namely, at pp. 25.
  144. 178. 253. 277. 285. (twice in the same page) 333. 382. It excites
  surprise that the word never, as far as I am aware, occurs in any of the
  voluminous works of Sir Thomas More, nor in any of the theological
  productions of the Reformers.</p>

  <p>With respect to <i>speare</i>, the orthography varies, as
  <i>spere</i>, <i>sperr</i>, <i>sparr</i>, <i>unspar</i>; but in the
  Prologue to <i>Troilus and Cressida</i>, <i>sperre</i> is Theobald's
  correction of <i>stirre</i>, in Folios '23 and '32. Let me add, what I
  had forgotten at the time, that another instance of <i>budde</i>
  intransitive, to bend, occurs at p. 105. of <i>The Life of Faith in
  Death</i>, by Samuel Ward, preacher of Ipswich, London, 1622. Also
  another, and a very significant one, of the phrase to <i>have on the
  hip</i>, in Fuller's <i>Historie of the Holy Warre</i>, Cambridge,
  1647:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Arnulphus was as quiet as a lambe, and durst never challenge his
  interest in Jerusalem from Godfrey's donation; as fearing to
  <i>wrestle</i> with the king, who <i>had him on the hip</i>, and could
  out him at pleasure for his bad manners."&mdash;Book ii. chap. viii. p.
  55.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In my note on the word <i>trash</i>, I said (somewhat too
  peremptorily) that <i>overtop</i> was not even a hunting term (Vol. vii.,
  p. 567.). At the moment I had forgotten the following passage:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Therefore I would perswade all lovers of hunting to get two or three
  couple of tryed hounds, and once or twice a week to follow after them a
  train-scent; and when he is able to <i>top</i> them on all sorts of
  earth, and to endure heats and colds stoutly, then he may the better
  relie on his speed and toughness."&mdash;<i>The Hunting-horse</i>, chap.
  vii. p. 71., Oxford, 1685.</p>

<h3>SNEEZING AN OMEN AND A DEITY.</h3>

  <p>In the <i>Odyssey</i>, xvii. 541-7., we have, imitating the
  hexameters, the following passage:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Thus Penelope spake. Then quickly Telemachus <i>sneez'd</i> loud,</p>
      <p><i>Sounding around all the building</i>: his mother, with smiles at her son, said,</p>
      <p>Swiftly addressing her rapid and high-toned words to Eumæus,</p>
<!-- Page 122 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page122"></a>{122}</span>
      <p class="hg1">'Go then directly, Eumæus, and call to my presence the strange guest.</p>
      <p>See'st thou not that my son, <i>ev'ry word I have spoken hath sneez'd at</i>?<a name="footnotetag5" href="#footnote5"><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>
      <p>Thus portentous, betok'ning the fate of my hateful suitors,</p>
      <p>All whom death and destruction await by a doom irreversive.'"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Dionysius Halicarnassus, on Homer's poetry (s. 24.), says, sneezing
  was considered by that poet as a good sign (<span title="sumbolon agathon" class="grk"
  >&sigma;&#x1F7B;&mu;&beta;&omicron;&lambda;&omicron;&nu;
  &#x1F00;&gamma;&alpha;&theta;&#x1F79;&nu;</span>); and from the Anthology
  (lib. ii.) the words <span title="oude legei, Zeu sôson, ean ptarêi" class="grk"
  >&omicron;&#x1F50;&delta;&#x1F72; &lambda;&#x1F73;&gamma;&epsilon;&iota;,
  &Zeta;&epsilon;&#x1FE6; &sigma;&#x1FF6;&sigma;&omicron;&nu;,
  &#x1F10;&#x1F70;&nu; &pi;&tau;&alpha;&rho;&#x1FC7;</span>, show that it
  was proper to exclaim "God bless you!" when any one sneezed.</p>

  <p>Aristotle, in the Problems (xxxiii. 7.), inquires why sneezing is
  reckoned a God (<span title="dia ti ton men ptarmon, theon hêgoumetha einai" class="grk"
  >&delta;&iota;&#x1F70; &tau;&#x1F77; &tau;&#x1F78;&nu; &mu;&#x1F72;&nu;
  &pi;&tau;&alpha;&rho;&mu;&#x1F78;&nu;, &theta;&epsilon;&#x1F78;&nu;
  &#x1F21;&gamma;&omicron;&#x1F7B;&mu;&epsilon;&theta;&alpha;
  &epsilon;&#x1F34;&nu;&alpha;&iota;</span>); to which he suggests, that it
  may be because it comes from the head, the most divine part about us
  (<span title="theiotatou tôn peri hêmas" class="grk"
  >&theta;&epsilon;&iota;&omicron;&tau;&#x1F71;&tau;&omicron;&upsilon;
  &tau;&#x1FF6;&nu; &pi;&epsilon;&rho;&#x1F76;
  &#x1F21;&mu;&#x1FB6;&sigmaf;</span>). Persons having the inclination, but
  not the power to sneeze, should look at the sun, for reasons he assigns
  in Problems (xxxiii. 4.).</p>

  <p>Plutarch, on the Dæmon of Socrates (s. 11.), states the opinion which
  some persons had formed, that Socrates' dæmon was nothing else than the
  sneezing either of himself or others. Thus, if any one sneezed at his
  right hand, either before or behind him, he pursued any step he had
  begun; but sneezing at his left hand caused him to desist from his formed
  purpose. He adds something as to different kinds of sneezing. To sneeze
  twice was usual in Aristotle's time; but once, or more than twice, was
  uncommon (Prob. xxxiii. 3.).</p>

  <p>Petronius (<i>Satyr</i>. c. 98.) notices the "blessing" in the
  following passage:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Giton collectione spiritus plenus, <i>ter</i> continuo ita
  sternutavit, ut grabatum concuteret. Ad quem motum Eumolpus conversus,

  <p>[The following proclamation on this subject is of interest at the

<p class="cenhead">By the King.</p>

  <p>A Proclamation to restrain the Abuses of Hackney Coaches in the Cities
  of London and Westminster, and the Suburbs thereof.</p>

  <p>Whereas the excessive number of Hackney Coaches, and Coach Horses, in
  and about the Cities of London and Westminster, and the Suburbs thereof,
  are found to be a common nuisance to the Publique Damage of Our People by
  reason of their rude and disorderly standing and passing to and fro, in
  and about our said Cities and Suburbs, the Streets and Highways being
  thereby pestred and made impassable, the Pavements broken up, and the
  Common Passages obstructed and become dangerous, Our Peace violated, and
  sundry other mischiefs and evils occasioned:</p>

  <p>We, taking into Our Princely consideration these apparent
  Inconveniences, and resolving that a speedy remedy be applied to meet
  with, and redress them for the future, do, by and with the advice of our
  Privy Council, publish Our Royal Will and Pleasure to be, and we do by
  this Our Proclamation expressly charge and command, That no Person or
  Persons, of what Estate, Degree, or Quality whatsoever, keeping or using
  any Hackney Coaches, or Coach Horses, do, from and after the Sixth day of
  November next, permit or suffer the said Coaches and Horses, or any of
  them, to stand or remain in any the Streets or Passages in or about Our
  said Cities either of London or Westminster, or the Suburbs belonging to
  either of them, to be there hired; but that they and every of them keep
  their said Coaches and Horses within their respective Coach-houses,
  Stables, and Yards (whither such Persons as desire to hire the same may
  resort for that purpose), upon pain of Our high displeasure, and such
  Forfeitures, Pains, and Penalties as may be inflicted for the Contempt of
  Our Royal Commands in the Premises, whereof we shall expect a strict
  Accompt.</p>

  <p>And for the due execution of Our Pleasure herein, We do further charge
  and command the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of Our City of London, That they
  in their several Wards, and Our Justices of Peace within Our said Cities
  of London and Westminster, and the Liberties and Suburbs thereof, and all
  other Our Officers and Ministers of Justice, to whom it appertaineth, do
  take especial care in their respective Limits that this Our Command be
  duly observed, and that they from time to time return the names of all
  those who shall wilfully offend in the Premises, to Our Privy Council,
  and to the end they may be proceeded against by Indictments and
  Presentments for the Nuisance, and otherwise according to the severity of
  the Law and Demerits of the Offenders.</p>

  <p>Given at Our Court at Whitehall the 18th day of October in the 12th
  year of Our Reign.</p>

<h3>SHAKSPEARE CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

  <p><i>Passage in "The Tempest," Act I. Sc. 2.</i>&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,</p>
      <p>But that the sea, mounting to the welkin's cheek,</p>
      <p>Dashes the fire out."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>"The manuscript corrector of the folio 1632," <span class="sc">Mr.
  Collier</span> informs us, "has substituted <i>heat</i> for 'cheek,'
  which is not an unlikely corruption, a person writing only by the
  ear."</p>

  <p>I should say very unlikely: but if <i>heat</i> had been actually
  printed in the folios, without speculating as to the probability that the
  press-copy was written from dictation, I should have had no hesitation in
  altering it to <i>cheek</i>. To this I should have been directed by a
  parallel passage in <i>Richard II.</i>, Act III. Sc. 3., which has been
  overlooked by <span class="sc">Mr. Collier</span>:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Methinks, King Richard and myself should meet</p>
      <p>With no less terror <i>than the elements</i></p>
      <p><i>Of fire and water, when their thundering shock</i></p>
      <p><i>At meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven</i>."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Commentary here is almost useless. Every one who has any capacity for
  Shakspearian criticism must feel assured that Shakspeare wrote
  <i>cheek</i>, and not <i>heat</i>.</p>

  <p>The passage I have cited from <i>Richard II.</i> strongly reminds me
  of an old lady whom I met last autumn on a tour through the Lakes of
  Cumberland, &amp;c.; and who, during a severe thunderstorm, expressed to
  me her surprise at the pertinacity of the lightning, adding, "I should
  think, Sir, that so much water in the heavens would have put all the fire
  out."</p>

  <p><i>The Case referred to by Shakspeare in Hamlet</i> (Vol. vii., p.
  550.).&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"If the water come to the man."&mdash;<i>Shakspeare.</i></p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The argument Shakspeare referred to was that contained in Plowden's
  Report of the case of Hales <i>v.</i> Petit, heard in the Court of Common
  Pleas in the fifth year of the reign of Queen Elizabeth. It was held that
  though the wife of Sir James Hale, whose husband was <i>felo-de-se</i>,
  became by survivorship the holder of a joint term for years, yet, on
  office found, it should be forfeited on account of the act of the
  deceased husband. The learned serjeants who were counsel for the
  defendant, alleged that the forfeiture should have relation to the act
  done in the party's lifetime, which was the cause of his death. "And upon
  this," they said, "the parts of the act are to be considered." And
  Serjeant Walsh said:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The act consists of three parts. The first is the imagination, which
  is a reflection or meditation of the mind, whether or no it is convenient
  for him to destroy himself, and what way it can be done. The second is
  the resolution, which is the determination of the mind to destroy
  himself, and to do it in this or that particular way. The third is the
  perfection, which is the execution of what the mind has resolved to do.
  And this perfection consists of two parts, viz. the beginning and the
  end. The beginning is the doing of the act which causes the death; and
  the end is the death, which is only the sequel to the act. And of all the
  parts, the doing of the act is the greatest in the judgment of our law,
  and it is, in effect, the whole and the only part the law looks upon to
  be material. For the imagination of the mind to do wrong, without an act
  done, is not punishable in our law; neither is the resolution to do that
  wrong which he does not, punishable; but the doing of the act is the only
  point the law regards, for until the act is done it cannot be an offence
  to the world, and when the act is done it is punishable. Then, here, the
  act done by Sir James Hale, which is evil and the cause of his death, is
  the throwing of himself into the water, and death is but a sequel
  thereof, and this evil act ought some way to be punished. And if the
  forfeiture shall not have relation to the doing of the act, then the act
  shall not be punished at all, for inasmuch as the person who did the act
  is dead, his person cannot be punished, and therefore there is no way
  else to punish him but by the forfeiture of those things which were his
  own at the time of the act done; and the act was done in his lifetime,
  and therefore the forfeiture shall have relation to his lifetime, namely,
  to that time of his life in which he did the act which took away his
  life."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>And the judges, viz. Weston, Anthony Brown, and Lord Dyer, said:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"That the forfeiture shall have relation to the time of the original
  offence committed, which was the cause of the death, and that was, the
  throwing himself into the water, which was done in his lifetime, and this
  act was felony."&mdash;&mdash;"So that the felony is attributed to the
  act, which act is always done by a living man and in his lifetime," as
  Brown said; for he said, "Sir James Hale was dead, and how came he to his
  death? It may be answered, By drowning. And who drowned him? Sir James
  Hale. And when did he drown him? In his lifetime. So that Sir James Hale
  being alive, caused Sir James Hale to die; and the act of the living man
  was the death of the dead man. And then for this offence it is reasonable
  to punish the living man who committed the offence, and not the dead man.
  But how can he be said to be punished alive when the punishment comes
  after his death? Sir, this can be done no other way but by devesting out
  of him, from the time of the act done in his life, which was the cause of
  his death, the title and property of those things which he had in his
  lifetime."</p>

  <p><i>Shakspeare Suggestion</i>.&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"These sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours;</p>
      <p>Most busy&mdash;less when I do it."</p>

  <p>I fear your readers will turn away from the very sight of the above.
  Be patient, kind friends, I will be brief. Has any one
  suggested&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Most busy, least when I do"?</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The words in the folio are</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Most busy <i>lest</i>, when I do it."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The "it" seems mere surplusage. The sense requires that the thoughts
  should be "most busy" whilst the hands "do least;" and in Shakspeare's
  time, "lest" was a common spelling for <i>least</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Shakspeare Controversy.</i>&mdash;I think the Shakspeare Notes
  contained in your volumes are not complete without the following
  quotation from <i>The Summer Night</i> of Ludwig Tieck, as translated by
  Mary Maynard in the <i>Athen.</i> of June 25, 1853. Puck, in addressing
  the sleeping boy Shakspeare, says:</p>

<h2>Minor Notes.</h2>

  <p><i>Falsified Gravestone in Stratford Churchyard.</i>&mdash;The
  following instance of a recent forgery having been extensively
  circulated, may lead to more careful examination by those who take notes
  of things extraordinary.</p>

  <p>The church at Stratford-upon-Avon was repaired about the year 1839;
  and some of the workmen having their attention directed to the fact, that
  many persons who had attained to the full age of man were buried in the
  churchyard; and, wishing "for the honour of the place," to improve the
  note-books of visitors, set about manufacturing an extraordinary instance
  of longevity. A gravestone was chosen in an out-of-the-way place, in
  which there happened to be a space before the age (72). A figure 1 was
  cut in this space, and the age at death then stood 172. The sexton was
  either deceived, or assented to the deception; as the late vicar, the
  Rev. J. Clayton, learned that it had become a practice with him (the
  sexton) to show strangers this gravestone, so falsified, as a proof of
  the extraordinary age to which people lived in the parish. The vicar had
  the fraudulent figure erased at once, and lectured the sexton for his
  dishonesty.</p>

  <p>These facts were related to me a few weeks since by a son of the late
  vicar. And as many strangers visiting the tomb of Shakspeare "made a
  note" of this falsified age, "N. &amp; Q." may now correct the
  forgery.</p>

  <p><i>Barnacles in the River Thames.</i>&mdash;In Porta's <i>Natural
  Magic</i>, Eng. trans., Lond. 1658, occurs the following curious
  passage:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Late writers report that not only in Scotland, but also in the river
  of Thames by London, there is a kind of shell-fish in a two-leaved shell,
  that hath a foot full of plaits and wrinkles: these fish are little,
  round, and outwardly white, smooth and beetle-shelled like an almond
  shell; inwardly they are great bellied, bred as it were of moss and mud;
  they commonly stick in the keel of some old ship. Some say they come of
  worms, some of the boughs of trees which fall into the sea; if any of
  them be cast upon shore they die, but they which are swallowed still into
  the sea, live and get out of their shells, and grow to be ducks or such
  like birds(!)."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It would be curious to know what could give rise to such an absurd
  belief.</p>

  <p><i>The Aliases and Initials of Authors.</i>&mdash;It has often
  occurred to me that it would save much useless inquiry and research, if a
  tolerable list could be collected of the principal authors who have
  published their works under assumed names or initials: thus, "R.&nbsp;B.
  Robert Burton," <i>Nathaniel Crouch</i>, "R.&nbsp;F. Scoto-Britannicus,"
  <i>Robert Fairley</i>, &amp;c. The commencement of a new volume of <!--
  Page 125 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page125"></a>{125}</span>"N.
  &amp; Q." affords an excellent opportunity for attempting this. If the
  correspondents of "N. &amp; Q." would contribute their mites occasionally
  with this view, by the conclusion of the volume, I have little doubt but
  a very valuable list might be obtained. For the sake of reference, the
  whole contributions obtained could then be amalgamated, and
  alphabetically arranged.</p>

  <p><i>Pure.</i>&mdash;In visiting an old blind woman the other day, I was
  struck with what to me was a peculiar use of the word <i>pure</i>. Having
  inquired after the dame's health, and been assured that she was much
  better, I begged her not to rise from the bed on which she was sitting,
  whereupon she said, "Thank you, Sir, I feel quite <i>pure</i> this
  morning."</p>

  <p><i>Darling's "Cyclopædia Bibliographica.</i>"&mdash;The utility of Mr.
  Darling's <i>Cyclopædia Bibliographica</i> is exemplified by the solution
  conveyed under the title "Crellius," p. 813, of the following difficulty
  expressed by Dr. Hey, the Norrisian professor (<i>Lectures</i>, vol. iii.
  p. 40.):</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Paul Crellius and John Maclaurin seem to have been of the same way of
  thinking with John Agricola. Nicholls, on this Article [Eighth of the
  Thirty-nine Articles], refers to Paul Crellius's book <i>De Libertate
  Christiana</i>, but I do not find it anywhere. A speech of his is in the
  <i>Bodleian Dialogue</i>, but not this work."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Similar information might have been received by your correspondent
  (Vol. vii., p. 381.), who inquired whether Huet's <i>Navigations of
  Solomon</i> was ever published. In the Cyclopædia reference is made to
  two collections in which this treatise has been inserted, <i>Crit.
  Sac</i>., viii.; <i>Ugolinus</i>, vii. 277. With his usual accuracy, Mr.
  Darling states there are additions in the <i>Critici Sacri</i> printed at
  Amsterdam, 1698-1732, as Huet's treatise above referred to is not in the
  first edition, London, 1660.</p>

<h3>DELFT MANUFACTURE.</h3>

  <p>I am extremely desirous of obtaining some information respecting the
  Dutch manufactories of enamelled pottery, or Delft ware, as we call
  it.</p>

  <p>On a former occasion, by your connexion with the <i>Navorscher</i>,
  you were able to obtain for me some very valuable and interesting
  information in reply to some question put respecting the Dutch porcelain
  manufactories. I am therefore in hopes that some kind correspondent in
  Holland will be so obliging as to impart to me similar information on
  this subject also. I should wish to know&mdash;</p>

  <p>When, by whom, at what places, and under what circumstances, the
  manufacture of enamelled pottery was first introduced into Holland?</p>

  <p>Whether there were manufactories at other towns besides Delft?</p>

  <p>Whether they had any distinctive marks; and, if so, what were
  they?</p>

  <p>Whether there was more than one manufactory at Delft; and, if so, what
  were their marks, and what was the meaning of them?</p>

  <p>Whether any particular manufactories were confined to the making of
  any particular sort or quality of articles; and, if so, what were
  they?</p>

  <p>Whether any of the manufactories have ceased; and, if so, at what
  period?</p>

  <p>Also, any other particulars respecting the manufactories and their
  products that it may be possible to communicate through the medium of a

<h3>BATTLE OF VILLERS EN COUCHÉ.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., p. 8.)</p>

  <p>I possess a singular work, consisting of a series of <i>Poetical
  Sketches</i> of the campaigns of 1793 and 1794, written, as the
  title-page asserts, by an "officer of the Guards;" who appears to have
  been, from what he subsequently states, on the personal staff of His
  Royal Highness the late Duke of York. This work, I have been given to
  understand, was suppressed shortly after its publication; the ludicrous
  light thrown by its pages on the conduct of many of the chief parties
  engaged in the transactions it records, being no doubt unpalatable to
  those high in authority. From the notes, which are valuable as appearing
  to emanate from an eye-witness, and sometimes an actor in the scenes he
  describes, I send the following extracts for the information of your
  correspondent; premising that the letter to which they are appended is
  dated from the "Camp at Inchin, April 26, 1794."</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"As the enemy were known to have assembled in great force at the Camp
  de Cæsar, near Cambray, Prince Cobourg requested the Duke of York would
  make a <i>reconnoissance</i> in that direction: accordingly, on the
  evening of the 23rd, Major-General Mansel's brigade of heavy cavalry was
  ordered about a league in front of their camp, where they lay that night
  at a farm-house, forming <i>part</i> of a detachment under General Otto.
  Early the next morning, an attack was made on the French drawn up in
  front of the village of Villers en Couchée (between Le Cateau and
  Bouchain) by the 15th regiment of Light Dragoons, and two squadrons of
  Austrian Hussars: they charged the enemy with such velocity and force,
  that, darting through their cavalry, they dispersed a line of infantry
  formed in their rear, forcing them also to retreat <!-- Page 128 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page128"></a>{128}</span>precipitately and in
  great confusion, under cover of the ramparts of Cambray; with a loss of
  1200 men, and three pieces of cannon. The only British officer wounded
  was Captain Aylett: sixty privates fell, and about twenty were
  wounded.</p>

  <p>"Though the heavy brigade was formed at a distance under a brisk
  cannonade, while the light dragoons had so glorious an opportunity of
  distinguishing themselves, there are none who can attach with propriety
  any blame on account of their unfortunate delay; for which General Otto
  was surely, as having the command, alone accountable, and not General
  Mansel, who acted at all times, there is no doubt, according to the best
  of his judgment for the good of the service.</p>

  <p>"The Duke of York had, on the morning of the 26th, observed the left
  flank of the enemy to be unprotected; and, by ordering the cavalry to
  wheel round and attack on that side, afforded them an opportunity of
  gaining the highest credit by defeating the French army so much superior
  to them in point of numbers.</p>

  <p>"General Mansel rushing into the thickest of the enemy, devoted
  himself to death; and animated by his example, that <i>very</i> brigade
  performed such prodigies of valour, as must have convinced the world that
  Britons, once informed <i>how to act</i>, justify the highest opinion
  that can possibly be entertained of their native courage. Could such men
  have <i>ever</i> been willingly <i>backward</i>? Certainly not.</p>

  <p>"General Mansel's son, a captain in the 3rd Dragoon Guards, anxious to
  save his father's life, had darted forwards, and was taken prisoner, and
  carried into Cambray. Since his exchange, he has declared that there was
  not, on the 26th, <i>a single French soldier</i> left in the town, as
  Chapuy had drawn out the whole garrison to augment the army destined to
  attack the camp of Inchi. Had that circumstance been fortunately known at
  the time, a detachment of the British army might easily have marched
  along the Chaussée, and taken possession of the place ere the Republicans
  could possibly have returned, as they had in their retreat described a
  circuitous detour of some miles."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Simpson</span> will perceive, from the above
  extracts, that the brilliant skirmish of Villers en Couché took place on
  April 24th; whereas the defeat of the French army under Chapuy did not
  occur until two days later. A large quantity of ammunition and
  thirty-five pieces of cannon were then captured; and although the writer
  does not mention the number who were killed on the part of the enemy,
  yet, as he states that Chapuy and near 400 of his men were made
  prisoners, their loss by death was no doubt proportionately large.</p>

  <p>The 15th Hussars have long borne on their colours the memorable words
  "Villers en Couché" to commemorate the daring valour they displayed on
  that occasion.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">T. C. Smith</span>.

  <p>In Cruttwell's <i>Universal Gazetteer</i> (1808), this village, which
  is five miles north-east of Cambray, is described as being "remarkable
  for an action between the French and the Allies on the 24th of April,
  1794." The following officers of the 15th regiment of light dragoons are
  there named as having afterwards received crosses of the Order of Maria
  Theresa for their gallant behaviour, from the Emperor of Germany,
  viz.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Major W. Aylett, Capt. Robert Pocklington, Capt. Edw. Michael Ryan,
  Lieut. Thos. Granby Calcraft, Lieut. Wm. Keir, Lieut. Chas. Burrel
  Blount, Cornet Edward Gerald Butler, and Cornet Robert Thos. Wilson."</p>

<h3>SNAIL-EATING.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., p. 33.)</p>

  <p>The Surrey snails referred to by <span class="sc">H.&nbsp;T. Riley</span>,
  are thus mentioned by Aubrey in his account of Box Hill:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"On the south downs of this county (Surrey), and in those of Sussex,
  are the biggest snails that ever I saw, twice or three times as big as
  our common snails, which are the Bavoli or Drivalle, which Mr. Elias
  Ashmole tells me that the Lord Marshal brought from Italy, and scattered
  them on the Downs hereabouts, and between Albury and Horsley, where are
  the biggest of all."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Again, Aubrey, in his <i>Natural History of Wiltshire</i>, says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The great snailes on the downes at Albury, in Surrey (twice as big as
  ours) were brought from Italy by *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Earle Marshal, about
  1638."&mdash;Aubrey's <i>History</i>, p. 10., edited by John Britton,
  F.S.A., published by the Wiltshire Topographical Society, 1847.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The first of these accounts, from Aubrey's <i>Surrey</i>, I have
  quoted in my <i>Promenade round Dorking</i>, 2nd edit. 1823, p. 274., and
  have added in a note:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"This was one of the Earls of Arundel. It is probably from this snail
  account that the error, ascribing the planting of the box (on Box Hill)
  to one of the Earls of Arundel, has arisen. The snails were brought
  thither for the Countess of Arundel, who was accustomed to dress and eat
  them for a consumptive complaint."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>When I lived at Dorking (1815-1821) a breed of large white snails was
  found on Box Hill.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">John Timbs</span>.

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. H. T. Riley</span> is informed that the breed of
  white snails he refers to is to be plentifully found in the neighbourhood
  of Shere. I have found them frequently near the neighbouring village of
  Albury, on St. Martha's Hill, and I am told they are to be met with in
  the lanes as far as Dorking. I have always heard that they were imported
  for the use of a lady who was in a consumption; but who this was, or when
  it happened, I have never been able to ascertain.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Nedlam</span>.

  <p>The breed of large white snails is to be found all along the
  escarpment of the chalk range, and is <!-- Page 129 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page129"></a>{129}</span>not confined to Surrey.
  It is said to have been introduced into England by Sir Kenelm Digby, and
  was considered very nutritious and wholesome for consumptive patients.
  About the end of the last century I was in the habit of collecting a few
  of the common garden snails from the fruit-trees, and taking them every
  morning to a lady who was in a delicate state of health; she took them
  boiled or stewed, or cooked in some manner with milk, making a
  mucilaginous drink.</p>

  <p class="author">E. H.

  <p>I have somewhere read of the introduction of a foreign breed of snails
  into Cambridgeshire, I forget the exact locality, for the table of the
  monks who imported them; but unfortunately it was before I commenced
  making "notes" on the subject, and I have not been able to recollect
  where to find it.</p>

<h3>INSCRIPTION NEAR CIRENCESTER.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., p. 76.)</p>

  <p>This inscription is not "in Earl Bathurst's park," as your
  correspondent <span class="sc">A. Smith</span> says, but is in Oakley
  Woods, situated at some three or four miles' distance from Cirencester,
  and being separated and quite distinct from the park; nor is the
  inscription correctly copied. Rudder, in his new <i>History of
  Gloucestershire</i>, 1779, says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Concealed as it were in the wood stands Alfred's Hall, a building
  that has the semblance of great antiquity. Over the door opposite to the
  south entrance, on the inside, is the following inscription in the Saxon
  character and language [of which there follows a copy]. Over the south
  door is the following Latin translation:</p>

  <p>"'F&oelig;dus quod Ælfredus &amp; Gythrunus reges, omnes <i>Anglia
  sapientes, &amp; quicunq</i>; Angliam in<i>c</i>olebant orientalem,
  ferierunt; &amp; non solum de seipsis, verum etiam de nat<i>i</i>s suis,
  ac nondum in lucem editis, quotquot misericordiæ divinæ aut regiæ
  vel<i>i</i>nt esse participes jurejurando sanxerunt.</p>

  <p>"'Primò ditionis nostræ fines ad T<i>h</i>amesin evehunt<i>u</i>r,
  inde ad Leam usq; ad fontem ejus; t<i>u</i>m recta ad Bedfordiam, ac
  deniq; per Usam ad viam Vetelin<i>g</i>ianam.'"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I copy from Rudder, with the stops and contracted "et's," as they
  stand in his work; though I think the original has points between each
  word, as marked by <span class="sc">A. Smith</span>.</p>

  <p>The omissions and mistakes of your correspondent (which you will
  perceive are important) are marked in Italics above.</p>

  <p>Rudder adds,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Behind this building is a ruin with a stone on the chimney-piece, on
  which, in ancient characters relieved on the stone, is this
  inscription:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'<span class="scac">IN . MEM . ALFREDI . REG . RESTAVR . ANO . DO</span> . 1085.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>"It would have been inexcusable in the topographer to have passed by
  so curious a place without notice; but the historian would have been
  equally culpable who should not have informed the reader that this
  building is an excellent imitation of antiquity. The name, the
  inscription, and the writing over the doors, of the convention between
  the good king and his pagan enemies, were probably all suggested by the
  similarity of <i>Achelie</i>, the ancient name of this place, to
  <i>Æcglea</i>, where King Alfred rested with his army the night before he
  attacked the Danish camp at Ethandun, and at length forced their leader
  Godrum, or Guthrum, or Gormund, to make such convention."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It is many years since I saw the inscription, and then I made no note
  of it; but I have no doubt that Rudder has given it correctly, because
  when I was a young man I was intimately acquainted with him, who was then
  an aged person; and a curious circumstance that occurred between us, and
  is still full in my memory, impressed me with the idea of his great
  precision and exactness.</p>

  <p>I would remark on the explanation given by Rudder, that the
  <i>Iglea</i> of Asser is supposed by Camden, Gibson, Gough, and Sir
  Richard Colt Hoare to be <i>Clayhill</i>, eastward of Warminster; and
  <i>Ethandun</i> to be <i>Edington</i>, about three miles eastward of
  Westbury, both in Wilts.</p>

  <p>Asser says that, "in the same year," the year of the battle, "the army
  of the pagans, departing from Chippenham, as had been promised, went to
  <i>Cirencester</i>, where they remained one year."</p>

  <p>On the signal defeat of Guthrum, he gave hostages to Alfred; and it is
  probable that, if any treaty was made between them, it was made
  immediately after the battle; and not that Alfred came from his fortress
  of <i>Æthelingay</i> to meet Guthrum at Cirencester, where his army lay
  after leaving Chippenham.</p>

  <p>If the treaty was made soon after the battle, it might have been at
  Alfred's Hall near Cirencester, especially if <i>Hampton</i>
  (Minchinhampton in Gloucestershire), which is only six miles from Oakley
  Wood, be the real site of the great and important battle, as was, a few
  years since, very plausibly argued by Mr. John Marks Moffatt, in a paper
  inserted, with the signature "J.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;M.," in Brayley's <i>Graphic and
  Historical Illustrator</i>, p. 106. <i>et seq.</i>, 1834.</p>

  <p>The mention of Rudder's History brings to my mind an inscription over
  the door of Westbury Court, which I noticed when a boy at school, in the
  village of Westbury in this county. This mansion was taken down during
  the minority of Maynard Colchester, Esq., the present owner of the
  estate. Rudder, in his account of that parish, has preserved the
  inscription&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i4">&nbsp;"D.</p>
      <p class="i4">O. M.</p>
      <p>N. M. M. H. E. P. N. C."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>He reads the first three letters "Deo Optimo Maximo," and says the
  subsequent line contains the initials of the following hexameter:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Nunc mea, mox hujus, et postea nescio cujus,"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
<p><!-- Page 130 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page130"></a>{130}</span></p>

  <p>alluding to the successive descent of property from one generation to
  another.</p>

  above line be original, or copied, and from whom.</p>

  <p>The agreement referred to is no other than the famous treaty of peace
  between Alfred and Guthrun, whose name, by the substitution of an initial
  "L." for a "G.," among various other inaccuracies for which your
  correspondent is perhaps not responsible, has been disguised under the
  form of "Lvthrvnvs." The inscription itself forms the commencement of the
  treaty, which is stated, in Turner's <i>Anglo-Saxons</i>, book iv. ch.
  v., to be still extant. It is translated as follows, in Lambard's <span

<h3>CURIOUS CUSTOM OF RINGING BELLS FOR THE
DEAD.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., p. 55.)</p>

  <p>W. W., alluding to such a custom at Marshfield, Massachusets, asks "if
  this custom ever did, or does now exist in the mother country?" The
  curiosity is that your worthy Querist has never heard of it! Dating from
  <i>Malta</i>, it may be he has never been in our <i>ringing island</i>:
  for it must be known to every Englishman, that the custom, varying no
  doubt in different localities, exists in every parish in England.</p>

  <p>The <i>passing bell</i> is of older date than the canon of our church,
  which directs "that when any is passing out of this life, a bell shall be
  tolled, and the minister shall not then slack to do his duty. And after
  the party's death, if it so fall out, then shall be rung no more than one
  short peal."</p>

  <p>It is interesting to learn that our colonists keep up this custom of
  their mother country.</p>

  <p>In this parish, the custom has been to ring as quickly after death as
  the sexton can be found; and the like prevails elsewhere. I have known
  persons, sensible of their approaching death, direct the bell at once to
  be tolled.</p>

  <p>Durand, in his <i>Rituals of the Roman Church</i>, says: "For expiring
  persons bells must be tolled, that people may put up their prayers: this
  must be done twice for a woman, and thrice for a man." And such is still
  the general custom: either before or after the <i>knell</i> is rung, to
  toll three times <i>three</i>, or three times <i>two</i>, at intervals,
  to mark the sex.<a name="footnotetag6"
  href="#footnote6"><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

  <p>"Defunctos plorare" is probably as old as any use of a bell; but there
  is every reason to believe that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"the ringing of bells at the departure of the soul (to quote from
  Brewster's <i>Ency.</i>) originated in the darkest ages, but with a
  different view from that in which they are now employed. It was to avert
  the influence of Demons. But if the superstition of our ancestors did not
  originate in this imaginary virtue, while they preserved the practice, it
  is certain they believed the mere noise had the same effect; and as,
  according to their ideas, evil spirits were always hovering around to
  make a prey of departing souls, the tolling of bells struck them with
  terror. We may trace the practice of tolling bells during funerals to the
  like source. This has been practised from times of great antiquity: the
  bells being muffled, for the sake of greater solemnity, in the same way
  as drums are muffled at military funerals."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">H. T. Ellacombe</span>.

  <p>Rectory, Clyst St. George.</p>

  <p>At St. James' Church, Hull, on the occurrence of a death in the
  parish, a bell is tolled quickly for about the space of ten minutes; and
  before ceasing, nine knells given if the deceased be a man, six if a
  woman, and three if a child. As far as I have been able to ascertain, the
  custom is now almost peculiar to the north of England; but in ancient
  times it must have been very general according to Durandus, who has the
  following in his <i>Rationale</i>, lib. i. cap. 4. 13.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Verum aliquo moriente, campanæ debent pulsari; ut populus hoc
  audiens, oret pro illo. Pro muliere quidem bis, pro eo quod invenit
  asperitatem.... Pro viro vero ter pulsator.... Si autem clericus sit, tot

</blockquote>

<p><!-- Page 131 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page131"></a>{131}</span></p>

  <p>Also a passage is quoted from an old English Homily, ending with:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"At the deth of a manne three bellis shulde be ronge, as his knyll, in
  worscheppe of the Trinetee; and for a womanne, who was the secunde
  persone of the Trinetee, two bellis should be rungen."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In addition to the intention of the "passing-bell," afforded by
  Durandus above, it has been thought that it was rung to drive away the
  evil spirits, supposed to stand at the foot of the bed ready to seize the
  soul, that it might "gain start." Wynkyn de Worde, in his <i>Golden
  Legend</i>, speaks of the dislike of spirits to bells. In alluding to
  this subject, Wheatly, in his work on the Book of Common Prayer, chap.
  xi. sec. viii. 3., says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Our Church, in imitation of the Saints of former ages, calls in the
  minister, and others who are at hand, to assist their brother in his last
  extremity."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The 67th canon enjoins that, "when any one is passing out of this
  life, a bell shall be tolled, and the minister shall not then slack to do
  his duty. And after the party's death, if it so fall out, there shall be
  rung <i>no more than one short peal</i>."</p>

  <p>Several other quotations might be adduced (vid. Brand's <i>Antiq.</i>,
  vol. ii. pp. 203, 204. from which much of the above has been derived) to
  show that "one short peal" was ordered only to be rung after the
  Reformation: the custom of signifying the sex of the deceased by a
  certain number of knells must be a relic, therefore, of very ancient
  usage, and unauthorised by the Church.</p>

<h3>WHO FIRST THOUGHT OF TABLE-TURNING?</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., p. 57.)</p>

  <p>Respecting the origin of this curious phenomenon in America, I am not
  able to give your correspondent, J.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;T. of Hagley, any information; but
  it may interest him and others among the readers of "N. &amp; Q." to have
  some account of what appears to be the first recorded experiment, made in
  Europe, of table-moving. These experiments are related in the supplement
  (now lying before me) to the <i>Allgemeine Zeitung</i> of April 4, by Dr.
  K. Andrée, who writes from Bremen on the subject. His letter is dated
  March 30, and begins by stating that the whole town had been for eight
  days preceding in a state of most peculiar excitement, owing to a
  phenomenon which entirely absorbed the attention of all, and about which
  no one had ever thought before the arrival of the American steam-ship
  "Washington" from New York. Dr. Andrée proceeds to relate that the
  information respecting table-moving was communicated in a letter, brought
  through that ship, from a native of Bremen, residing in New York, to his
  sister, who was living in Bremen, and who, in her correspondence with her
  brother, had been rallying him about the American spirit-rappings, and
  other Yankee humbug, as she styled it, so rampant in the United States.
  Her brother instanced this table-moving, performed in America, as no
  delusion, but as a fact, which might be verified by any one; and then
  gave some directions for making the experiment, which was forthwith
  attempted at the lady's house in Bremen, and with perfect success, in the
  presence of a large company. In a few days the marvellous feat, the
  accounts of which flew like wildfire all over the country, was executed
  by hundreds of experimenters in Bremen. The subject was one precisely
  adapted to excite the attention and curiosity of the imaginative and
  wonder-loving Germans; and, accordingly, in a few days after, a notice of
  the strange phenomenon appeared in <i>The Times</i>, in a letter from
  Vienna, and, through the medium of the leading journal, the facts and
  experiments became rapidly diffused over the world, and have been
  repeated and commented upon ten thousand fold. As the experiment and its
  results are now brought within the domain of practical science, we may
  hope to see them soon freed from the obscurity and <span
  class="correction" title="text reads `uncertainly'">uncertainty</span>
  which still envelope them, and assigned to their proper place in the
  wondrous system of "Him, in whom we live, and move, and have our
  being."</p>

<h3>SCOTCHMEN IN POLAND.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., pp. 475. 600.)</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Religious freedom was at that time [the middle of the sixteenth
  century] enjoyed in Poland to a degree unknown in any other part of
  Europe, where generally the Protestants were persecuted by the Romanists,
  or the Romanists by the Protestants. This freedom, united to commercial
  advantages, and a wide field for the exercise of various talents,
  attracted to Poland crowds of foreigners, who fled their native land on
  account of religious persecution; and many of whom became, by their
  industry and talents, very useful citizens of their adopted country.
  There were at Cracow, Vilna, Posen, &amp;c., Italian and French
  Protestant congregations. A great number of Scotch settled in different
  parts of Poland; and there were Scotch Protestant congregations not only
  in the above-mentioned towns, but also in other places, and a
  particularly numerous one at Kieydany, a little town of Lithuania,
  belonging to the Princes Radziwill. Amongst the Scotch families settled
  in Poland, the principal were the Bonars, who arrived in that country
  before the Reformation, but became its most zealous adherents. This
  family rose, by its wealth, and the great merit of several of its
  members, to the highest dignities of the state, but became extinct during
  the seventeenth century. There are even now in Poland many families of
  Scotch descent belonging to the class of nobles; as, for instance, <!--
  Page 132 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page132"></a>{132}</span>the
  Haliburtons, Wilsons, Ferguses, Stuarts, Haslers, Watsons, &amp;c. Two
  Protestant clergymen of Scotch origin, Forsyth and Inglis, have composed
  some sacred poetry. But the most conspicuous of all the Polish Scotchmen
  is undoubtedly Dr. John Johnstone [born in Poland 1603, died 1675],
  perhaps the most remarkable writer of the seventeenth century on natural
  history. It seems, indeed, that there is a mysterious link connecting the
  two distant countries; because, if many Scotsmen had in bygone days
  sought and found a second fatherland in Poland, a strong and active
  sympathy for the sufferings of the last-named country, and her exiled
  children, has been evinced in our own times by the natives of Scotland in
  general, and by some of the most distinguished amongst them in
  particular. Thus it was an eminent bard of Caledonia, the gifted author
  of <i>The Pleasures of Hope</i>, who, when</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Sarmatia fell, unwept, without a crime,'</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>has thrown, by his immortal strains, over the fall of her liberty, a
  halo of glory which will remain unfaded as long as the English language
  lasts. The name of Thomas Campbell is venerated throughout all Poland;
  but there is also another Scotch name [Lord Dudley Stuart] which is
  enshrined in the heart of every true Pole."&mdash;From Count Valerian
  Krasinski's <i>Sketch of the Religious History of the Sclavonic
  Nations</i>, p. 167.: Edinburgh, Johnstone and Hunter, 1851.</p>

<h3>ANTICIPATORY USE OF THE CROSS.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., pp. 548. 629.)</p>

  <p>I think <span class="sc">The Writer of "Communications with the Unseen
  World</span>" would have some difficulty in referring to the works on
  which he based the statement that "it was a tradition in Mexico that when
  that form (the cross) should be victorious, the old religion should
  disappear, and that a similar tradition attached to it at Alexandria." He
  doubtless made the statement from memory, and unintentionally confounded
  two distinct facts, viz. that the Mexicans worshipped the cross, and had
  prophetic intimations of the downfall of their nation and religion by the
  oppression of bearded strangers from the East. The quotation by <span
  class="sc">Mr. Peacock</span> at p. 549., quoted also in Purchas'
  <i>Pilgrims</i>, vol. v., proves, as do other authorities, that the cross
  was worshipped in Mexico prior to the Spanish invasion, and therefore it
  was impossible that the belief mentioned by <span class="sc">The
  Writer</span>, &amp;c. could have prevailed.</p>

  <p>On the first discovery of Yucatan,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Grijaha was astonished at the sight of large crosses, evidently
  objects of worship."&mdash;Prescott's <i>Mexico</i>, vol. i. p. 203.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Mr. Stephens, in his <i>Central America</i>, vol. ii., gives a
  representation of one of these crosses. The cross on the Temple of
  Serapis, mentioned in Socrates' <i>Ecc. Hist.</i>, was undoubtedly the
  well-known <i>Crux ansata</i>, the symbol of life. It was as the latter
  that the heathens appealed to it, and the Christians explained it to them
  as fulfilled in the Death of Christ.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Peacock</span> asks for other instances: I
  subjoin some.</p>

  <p>In <i>India</i>.&mdash;The great pagoda at Benares is built in the
  form of a cross. (Maurice's <i>Ind. Ant.</i>, vol. iii. p. 31., City,
  Tavernier.)</p>

  <p>On a Buddhist temple of cyclopean structure at Mundore (Tod's
  <i>Rajasthan</i>, vol. i. p. 727.), the cross appears as a sacred figure,
  together with the double triangle, another emblem of very wide
  distribution, occurring on ancient British coins (Camden's
  <i>Britannica</i>), Central American buildings (Norman's <i>Travels in
  Yucatan</i>), among the Jews as the Shield of David (Brucker's <i>History
  of Philosophy</i>), and a well-known masonic symbol frequently introduced
  into Gothic ecclesiastical edifices.</p>

  <p>In <i>Palestine</i>.&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"According to R. Solomon Jarchi, the Talmud, and Maimonides, when the
  priest sprinkled the blood of the victim on the consecrated cakes and
  hallowed utensils, he was always careful to do it in the form of a
  <i>cross</i>. The same symbol was used when the kings and high priests
  were anointed."&mdash;Faber's <i>Horæ Mosaicæ</i>, vol. ii. p. 188.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>See farther hereon, Deane on <i>Serpent Worship</i>.</p>

  <p>In <i>Persia</i>.&mdash;The trefoil on which the sacrifices were
  placed was probably held sacred from its cruciform character. The cross
  (<a href="images/197_016.png"><img src="images/197_016.png"
  class="middle" style="height:2ex" alt="+" /></a>) occurs on Persian
  buildings among other sacred symbols. (R.&nbsp;K. Porter's <i>Travels</i>,
  vol. ii.)</p>

  <p>In <i>Britain</i>.&mdash;The cross was formed by baring a tree to a
  stump, and inserting another crosswise on the top; on the three arms thus
  formed were inscribed the names of the three principal, or triad of gods,
  <i>Hesus</i>, <i>Belenus</i>, and <i>Taranis</i>. The stone avenues of
  the temple at Classerniss are arranged in the form of a cross. (Borlase's
  <i>Antiquities of Cornwall</i>.)</p>

  <p>In <i>Scandinavia</i>.&mdash;The hammer of Thor was in the form of the
  cross; see in Herbert's <i>Select Icelandic Poetry</i>, p. 11., and
  Laing's <i>Kings of Norway</i>, vol. i. pp. 224. 330., a curious anecdote
  of King Hacon, who, having been converted to Christianity, made the sign
  of the cross when he drank, but persuaded his irritated Pagan followers
  that it was the sign of Thor's hammer.</p>

  <p>The figure of Thor's hammer was held in the utmost reverence by his
  followers, who were called the children of Thor, who in the last day
  would save themselves by his mighty hammer. The fiery cross, so well
  known by Scott's vivid description, was originally the hammer of Thor,
  which in early Pagan, as in later Christian times, was used as a summons
  to convene the people either to council or to war. (Herbert's <i>Select
  Icelandic Poetry</i>, p. 11.)</p>

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHIC CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

  <p><i>Glass Chambers for Photography.</i>&mdash;I am desirous to
  construct a small glass chamber for taking portraits in, and shall be
  much obliged if you can assist me by giving me instructions how it should
  be constructed, or by directing me where I shall find clear and
  sufficient directions, as to dimensions, materials, and arrangements. Is
  it essential that it should be all of violet-coloured glass, ground at
  one side, as that would add a good deal to the expense? or will white
  glass, with thin blue gauze curtains or blinds, answer?</p>

  <p>Probably a full answer to this inquiry, accompanied with such woodcut
  illustrations as would be necessary to render the description complete,
  and such as an artificer could work by, would confer a boon on many
  amateur photographers, as well as your obliged servant,</p>

  <p class="author">C. E. F.

<div class="note">
  <p>[In the construction of a photographic house, we beg to inform our
  correspondent that it is by no means needful to use entirely
  violet-coloured glass, but the roof thereof exposed to the rays of the
  sun should be so protected; for although the light is much subdued, and
  the glare so painful to the eyes of the sitter is taken away, yet but few
  of the actinic rays are obstructed. It has been proposed to coat the
  interior with smalt mixed with starch, and afterwards varnished; but this
  does not appear to have answered. Calico, both white and coloured, has
  also been used, but it is certainly not so effectual or pleasant. Upon
  the whole, we think that the main things to attend to are, firmness in
  its construction, so as to avoid vibration; ample size, so as to allow
  not only of room for the operator, but also for the arrangements of
  background, &amp;c., and the sides to open so as to allow a free
  circulation of air; blinds to be <i>applied at such spots only</i> as
  shall be found requisite. Adjoining, or in one corner, a small closet
  should be provided, admitting only yellow light, which may be effectually
  accomplished by means of yellow calico. A free supply of water is
  indispensable, which may be conveyed both to and from by means of the
  gutta percha tubing now in such general use. We apprehend, however, that
  the old proverb, "You must cut your coat according to your cloth," is
  most especially applicable to our querist, for not only must the house be
  constructed according to the advantages afforded by the locality, but the
  amount of expense will be very differently thought of by different
  persons: one will be content with any moderate arrangement which will
  answer the purpose, where another will be scarcely satisfied unless
  everything is quite of an <i>orné</i> character.]</p>

</div>

  <p><i>Dr. Diamond's Replies.</i>&mdash;I am sorry I have not before
  replied to the Queries of your correspondent W.&nbsp;F.&nbsp;E., contained in Vol.
  viii., p. 41.; but absence from home, together with a pressure of public
  duties here, has prevented me from so doing.</p>

  <p>1st. No doubt a <i>small</i> portion of nitrate of potash is formed
  when the iodized collodion is immersed in the bath of nitrate of silver,
  by mutual decomposition; but it is in so small a quantity as not to
  deteriorate the bath.</p>

  <p>2nd. I believe collodion will keep good much longer than is generally
  supposed; at the beginning of last month I obtained a tolerably good
  portrait of Mr. Pollock from some remains in a small bottle brought to me
  by Mr. Archer in September 1850; and I especially notice this fact, as it
  is connected with the first introduction of the use of collodion in
  England. Generally speaking, I do not find that it deteriorates in two or
  three months; the addition of a few drops of the iodizing solution will
  generally restore it, unless it has become rotten: this, I think, is the
  case when the gun cotton has not been perfectly freed from the acid. The
  redness which collodion assumes by age, may also be discharged by the
  addition of a few drops of liquor ammoniæ, but I do not think it in any
  way accelerates its activity of action.</p>

  <p>3rd. "Washed ether," or, as it is sometimes called, "inhaling ether,"
  has been deprived of the alcohol which the common ether contains, and it
  will not dissolve the gun cotton unless the alcohol is restored to it. I
  would here observe that an excess of alcohol (spirits of wine) thickens
  the collodion, and gives it a mucilaginous appearance, rendering it much
  more difficult to use by its slowness in flowing over the glass plate, as
  well as producing a less even surface than when nearly all ether is used.
  A collodion, however, with thirty-five per cent. of spirits of wine, is
  very quick, allowing from its less tenacious quality a more rapid action
  of the nitrate of silver bath.</p>

  <p>4th. Cyanide of potassium has been used to re-dissolve the iodide of
  silver, but the results are by no means so satisfactory; the cost of pure
  iodide of potassium bought at a <i>proper market</i> is certainly very
  inconsiderable compared to the disappointment resulting from a false
  economy.</p>

  <p><i>Trial of Lenses.</i>&mdash;When you want to try a lens, first be
  sure that the slides of your camera are correctly constructed, which is
  easily done. Place at any distance you please a sheet of paper printed in
  small type; focus this on your ground glass with the assistance of a
  magnifying-glass; now take the slide which carries your plate of glass,
  and if you have not a piece of ground glass at hand, insert a plate which
  you would otherwise excite in the bath after the application of
  collodion, but now <i>dull</i> it by touching it with putty. Observe
  whether you get an equally clear and well-focussed picture on this; if
  you do, you may conclude there is no fault in the construction of your
  camera.</p>

  <p>Having ascertained this, take a chess-board, and place the pieces on
  the row of squares which run <!-- Page 134 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page134"></a>{134}</span>from corner to corner; focus the middle
  one, whether it be king, queen, or knight, and take a picture; you will
  soon see whether the one best in the visual focus is the best on the
  picture, or whether the piece one or more squares in advance or behind it
  is clearer than the one you had previously in focus. The chess-board must
  be set square with the camera, so that each piece is farther off by one
  square. To vary the experiment, you may if you please stick a piece of
  printed paper on each piece, which a little gum or common bees'-wax will
  effect for you.</p>

  <p>In taking portraits, if you are not an adept in obtaining a focus, cut
  a slip of newspaper about four inches long, and one and a half wide, and
  turn up one end so as it may be held between the lips, taking care that
  the rest be presented quite flat to the camera; with the help of a
  magnifying-glass set a correct focus to this, and afterwards draw in the
  tube carrying the lenses about one-sixteenth of a turn of the screw of
  the rackwork. This will give a medium focus to the head: observe, as the
  length of focus in different lenses varies, the distance the tube is
  moved must be learned by practice.</p>

  <p><i>Is it dangerous to use the Ammonio-Nitrate of
  Silver?</i>&mdash;Some time ago I made a few ounces of a solution of
  ammonio-nitrate of silver for printing positives; this I have kept in a
  yellow coloured glass bottle with a ground stopper.</p>

  <p>I have, however, been much alarmed, and refrained from using it or
  taking out the stopper, lest danger should arise, in consequence of
  reading in Mr. Delamotte's <i>Practice of Photography</i>, p. 95. (vide
  "Ammonia Solution"):</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"If any of the ammonio-nitrate dries round the stopper of the bottle
  in which it is kept, the least friction will cause it to explode
  violently; it is therefore better to keep none prepared."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>As in pouring this solution out and back into the bottle, of course
  the solution will dry around the stopper, and, if this account is
  correct, may momentarily lead to danger and accident, I will feel obliged
  by being informed by some of your learned correspondents whether any such
  danger exists.</p>

  infancy, which the Wistaston parish register may show, and which register
  would perhaps also show (supposing Milton took his wife from Wistaston)

  <p>I am myself possessed of a white cat which, at the advanced age of

  are usually given credit for. Its affection for persons is, indeed, more
  like that of a dog than of a cat. It is a half-bred Persian cat, and its
  eyes are perfectly blue, with round pupils, not elongated as those of
  cats usually are. It occasionally suffers from irritation in the ears,
  but this has not at all resulted in deafness.</p>

  <p><i>House-marks</i> (Vol. vii., p. 594.).&mdash;It appears to me that
  the <i>house-marks</i> he alluded to may be traced in what are called
  <i>merchants' marks</i>, still employed in marking bales of wool, cotton,
  &amp;c., and which are found on tombstones in our old churches,
  <i>incised</i> in the slab during the sixteenth and seventeenth
  centuries, and which till lately puzzled the heralds. They were borne by
  merchants who had no arms.</p>

  <p><i>Trash</i> (Vol. vii., p. 566.).&mdash;The late Mr. Scatchard, of
  Morley, near Leeds, speaking in Hone's <i>Table Book</i> of the Yorkshire
  custom of <i>trashing</i>, or throwing an old shoe for luck over a
  wedding party, says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Although it is true that an old shoe is to this day called 'a trash,'
  yet it did not, certainly, give the name to the nuisance. To 'trash'
  originally signified to clog, encumber, or impede the progress of any one
  (see Todd's <i>Johnson</i>); and, agreeably to this explanation, we find
  the rope tied by sportsmen round the necks of fleet pointers to tire them
  well, and check their speed, is hereabouts universally called 'trash
  cord,' or 'dog trash.' A few miles distant from Morley, west of Leeds,
  the 'Boggart' or 'Barguest,' the Yorkshire Brownie is called by the
  people the <i>Gui-trash</i>, or <i>Ghei-trash</i>, the usual description
  of which is invariably that of a shaggy dog or other animal,
  <i>encumbered</i> with a chain round its neck, which is heard to rattle
  in its movements. I have heard the common people in Yorkshire say, that
  they 'have been <i>trashing</i> about all day;' using it in the sense of
  having had a tiring walk or day's work.</p>

  <p>"East of Leeds the 'Boggart' is called the <i>Padfoot</i>."</p>

  <p><i>Adamsoniana</i> (Vol. vii., p. 500.).&mdash;Michel Ada<i>n</i>son

  of Senegal (<i>Adansonia digitata</i>), and his memory to all who
  appreciate the advantages of a natural classification of plants&mdash;for
  which Jussieu was indebted to him&mdash;was the son of a gentleman, who
  after firmly attaching himself to the Stuarts, left Scotland and entered
  the service of the Archbishop of Aix. The <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i>,
  and, I imagine, almost all biographical dictionaries and similar works,
  contain notices of him. His devoted life has deserved a more lengthened
  chronicle.</p>

  <p>Your correspondent E. H. A., who inquires respecting the family of
  Michel Adamson, or Michael Adamson, is informed that in France, the
  country of his birth, the name is invariably written "Ada<i>n</i>son;"
  while the author of <i>Fanny of Caernarvon, or the War of the Roses</i>,
  is described as "John Ada<i>m</i>son." Both names are pronounced alike in
  French; but the difference of spelling would seem adverse to the
  supposition that the family of the botanist was of Scottish
  extraction.</p>

  <p><i>English Bishops deprived by Queen Elizabeth</i> (Vol. vii., pp.
  260. 344. 509.).&mdash;The following particulars concerning one of the
  Marian Bishops are at A.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;A.'s service. Cuthbert Scot, D.D., sometime
  student, and, in 1553, Master of Christ's Church College, Cambridge, was
  made Vice-Chancellor of that University in 1554-5; and had the
  temporalities of the See of Chester handed to him by Queen Mary in 1556.
  He was one of Cardinal Pole's delegates to the University of Cambridge,
  and was concerned in most of the political movements of the day. He, and
  four other bishops, with as many divines, undertook to defend the
  principles and practices of the Romish Church against an equal number of
  Reformed divines. On the 4th of April he was confined, either in the
  Fleet Prison or the Tower, for abusive language towards Queen Elizabeth;
  but having by some means or other escaped from <i>durance</i>, he retired
  to Louvain, where he died, according to Rymer's <i>F&oelig;dera</i>,
  about 1560.</p>

  <p>As the following extract from Gorr's <i>Liverpool Directory</i>
  appears to bear upon the point, and as it does not seem to have yet
  attracted the attention of any of your correspondents, I beg to forward
  it:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Its (<i>i.e.</i> Liverpool's) fair-days are 25th July and 11th Nov.
  Ten days before and ten days after each fair-day, a hand is exhibited in
  front of the Town-hall, which denotes protection; during which time no
  person coming to or going from the town on business connected with the
  fair can be arrested for debt within its liberty."</p>

  <p>I have myself frequently observed the "hand," although I could not
  discover any appearance of a fair being held.</p>

  <p><i>St. Dominic</i> (Vol. vii., p. 356.).&mdash;Your correspondent

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">J. S. Warden</span>.

  <p><i>Names of Plants</i> (Vol. viii., p. 37.).&mdash;Ale-hoof means
  useful in, or to, ale; Ground-ivy having been used in brewing before the
  introduction of hops. "The women of our northern parts" (says John
  Gerard), "especially about Wales or Cheshire, do tunne the herbe Ale-hoof
  into their ale ... being tunned up in ale and drunke, it also purgeth the
  head from rhumaticke humours flowing from the brain." From the aforesaid
  tunning, it was also called Tun-hoof (<i>World of Words</i>); and in
  Gerard, Tune-hoof. <!-- Page 137 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>Considering what was meant by Lady in the names of plants, we should
  refrain from supposing that <i>Neottia spiralis</i> was called the
  Lady-traces "sensu obsc.," even if those who are more skilled in such
  matters than I am can detect such a sense. I cannot learn what a lady's
  <i>traces</i> are; but I suspect plaitings of her hair to be meant. "Upon
  the spiral sort," says Gerard, "are placed certaine small white flowers,
  <i>trace</i> fashion," while other sorts grow, he says, "spike fashion,"
  or "not <i>trace</i> fashion." Whence I infer, that in his day
  <i>trace</i> conveyed the idea of spiral.</p>

  <p><i>Pistols</i> (Vol. viii., p. 7.).&mdash;In Strype's Life of Sir

  proclamation by the Queen in the year 1575, which refers to that of 33
  Hen. VIII. c. 6., alluded to by your correspondent J.&nbsp;F.&nbsp;M., and in which
  the words <i>pistol</i> and <i>pistolet</i> are introduced:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The Queen calling to mind how unseemly a thing it was, in so quiet
  and peaceable a realm, to have men so armed; ... did charge and command
  all her subjects, of what estate or degree soever they were, that in no
  wise, in their journeying, going, or riding, they carried about them
  privily or openly any dag, or pistol, or any other harquebuse, gun, or
  such weapon for fire, under the length expressed by the statute made by
  the Queen's most noble father.... [Excepting however] noblemen and such
  known gentlemen, which were without spot or doubt of evil behaviour, if
  they carried dags or pistolets about them in their journeys, openly, at
  their saddle bows," &amp;c.</p>

  <p><i>Passage of Thucydides on the Greek Factions</i> (Vol. viii., p.

  compare the passage quoted, and the one referred to by him, in the
  following translation of Smith, with Sir A. Alison's supposititious
  quotation<a name="footnotetag7" href="#footnote7"><sup>[7]</sup></a>
  (Vol. vii., p. 594.), they will find that my inquiry is still unanswered.
  The passage quoted by L. in Greek is, according to Smith:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Prudent consideration, to be specious cowardice; modesty, the
  disguise of effeminacy; and being wise in everything, to be good for
  nothing."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The passage not quoted, but referred to by L., is:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"He who succeeded in a roguish scheme was wise; and he who suspected
  such practices in others was still a more able genius."&mdash;Vol. i.
  book iii. p. 281. 4to.: London, 1753.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In this "counterfeit presentment of two brothers," L. may discern a
  family likeness; but my inquiry was for the identical passage, "sword and
  poniard" included.</p>

  <p>If L. desires to find Greek authority for the general sentiment only,
  I would refer him to passages, equally to Sir A. Alison's purpose, in
  <i>Thucydides</i>, iii. 83., viii. 89.; <i>Herodotus</i>, iii. 81.;
  Plato's <i>Republic</i>, viii. 11., and Aristotle's <i>Politics</i>, v.

  <p><i>Creole</i> (Vol. vii., p. 381.).&mdash;It is curious to observe how
  differently this word is applied by different nations. The English apply
  it to white children born in the West Indies; the French, I believe,
  exclusively to the mixed races; and the Spanish and Portuguese to the
  blacks born in their colonies, never to whites. The latter, I think, is
  the true and original meaning, as its primary signification is a
  <i>home-bred</i> slave (from "criar," to bring up, to nurse), as
  distinguished from an imported or purchased one.</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous.</h2>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.</h3>

  <p>We have before us a little volume by Mr. Willich, the able Actuary of
  the University Life Assurance Society, entitled <i>Popular Tables
  arranged in a new Form, giving Information at Sight for ascertaining,
  according to the Carlisle Table of Mortality, the Value of Lifehold,
  Leasehold, and Church Property, Renewal Fines, &amp;c., the Public Funds,
  Annual Average Price and Interest on Consols from 1731 to 1851; also
  various interesting and useful Tables, equally adapted to the Office and
  the Library Table</i>. Ample as is this title-page, it really gives but
  an imperfect notion of the varied contents of this useful library and
  writing-desk companion. For instance, Table VIII. of the Miscellaneous
  Tables gives the average price of Consols, with the average rate of
  interest, from 1731 to 1851; but this not only shows when Consols were
  highest and when lowest, but also what Administration was then in power,
  and the chief events of each year. We give this as one instance of the
  vast amount of curious information here combined; and we would point out
  to historical and geographical students the notices of Chinese Chronology
  in the preface, and the Tables of Ancient and Modern Itinerary Measures,
  as parts of the work especially deserving of their attention. In short,
  Mr. Willich's <i>Popular Tables</i> form one of those useful volumes in
  which masses of scattered information are concentrated in such a way as
  to render the book indispensable to all who have once tested its
  utility.</p>

  <p><i>Mormonism, its History, Doctrines, and Practices</i>, by the Rev.
  W. Sparrow Simpson, is a small pamphlet containing the substance of two
  lectures on this pestilent heresy, delivered by the author before the
  Kennington Branch of the Church of England Young Men's Society, and is
  worth the attention of those who wish to know something of this now
  wide-spread mania.</p>

  <p><i>On the Custom of Borough-English in the County of Sussex</i>, by
  George R. Corner, Esq. This well-considered paper on a very curious
  custom owes its origin, we believe, to a Query in our columns. We wish
  all questions agitated in "N. &amp; Q." were as well illustrated as this
  has been by the learning and ingenuity of Mr. Corner.</p>

  <p><i>A Narrative of Practical Experiments proving to Demonstration the
  Discovery of Water, Coals, and Minerals in the Earth by means of the
  Dowsing Fork or Divining Rod, &amp;c., collected, reported, and
  edited</i> by Francis Phippen. A curious little pamphlet on a <i>fact</i>
  in Natural Philosophy, which we believe no philosopher can either
  understand or account for.</p>

  the same subject in our own columns.</p>

  <p>* <span class="sc">Example.</span>&mdash;At the commencement of the
  year 1841, a person aged thirty took out a Policy for 1000<i>l.</i>, the
  annual payment for which is 24<i>l.</i> 1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>; in 1847 he
  had paid in premiums 168<i>l.</i> 11<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>; but the profits
  being 2¼ per cent. per annum on the sum insured (which is 22<i>l.</i>
  10<i>s.</i> per annum for each 1000<i>l.</i>) he had 157<i>l.</i>
  10<i>s.</i> added to the Policy, almost as much as the premiums paid.</p>

  <p>The Premiums, nevertheless, are on the most moderate scale, and only
  one-half need be paid for the first five years, when the Insurance is for
  Life. Every information will be afforded on application to the Resident

  <p class="author">"Bonn, July 19. 1852.

  <p>"This light and pleasant Farina is one of the most excellent,
  nourishing, and restorative remedies, and supersedes, in many cases, all
  kinds of medicines. It is particularly useful in confined habit of body,
  as also diarrh&oelig;a, bowel complaints, affections of the kidneys and
  bladder, such as stone or gravel; inflammatory irritation and cramp of
  the urethra, cramp of the kidneys and bladder, strictures, and
  hemorrhoids. This really invaluable remedy is employed with the most
  satisfactory result, not only in bronchial and pulmonary complaints,
  where irritation and pain are to be removed, but also in pulmonary and
  bronchial consumption, in which it counteracts effectually the
  troublesome cough; and I am enabled with perfect truth to express the
  conviction that Du Barry's Revalenta Arabica is adapted to the cure of
  incipient hectic complaints and consumption.</p>

  Introduction by the Rev. ARTHUR CLEVELAND COXE, M.A., Rector of St.

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The following work will be found a noble apology for the position
  assumed by the Church of England in the sixteenth century, and for the
  practical reforms she then introduced into her theology and worship. If
  the author is right, then the changes he so eloquently urges upon the
  present attention of his brethren ought to have been made <i>three
  hundred years ago</i>; and the obstinate refusal of the Council of Trent
  to make such reforms in conformity with Scripture and Antiquity, throws
  the whole burthen of the sin of schism upon Rome, and not upon our
  Reformers. The value of such admissions must, of course, depend in a
  great measure upon the learning, the character, the position, and the
  influence of the author from whom they proceed. The writer believes, that
  questions as to these particulars can be most satisfactorily
  answered."&mdash;<i>Introduction by Arthur Cleveland Coxe.</i></p>
